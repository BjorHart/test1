# Summer-Intern-Project-2019
This repo is for the Summer Interns 2019 and their robotic arm project.

The repo contains folders with essential documentation and setup instructions for all major parts of the project.
There is also a Quick setup-guide for launching the Digital Twin, provided that all other elements are configured correctly.
Below is a list of the folders followed by a short introduction to the content in each folder for faster navigation.

#### Quick setup-guide
If both Arduino boards have all pins correctly placed (according to the documentation) and the braccio-board is connected to the right YUN, the following steps are required to launch the complete application

1. Plug both Arduinos and the Braccio robotic arm into a power outlet. Wait for blue lights to appear on both Arduino YÃºn boards (indicating connected to WIFI), if they dont appear, see further documentation for setup [here](https://github.com/EDRoMedeso/Summer-Intern-Project-2019/tree/master/Arduino).
2. On the virtual machine; run run.bat located in the Summer interns folder. This will start the runtime simulation of the robotic arm as well as start the Vuforia server.
3.  Grab a tablet or a Hololens, scan the Thingmark (number 34592:1) and start viewing the Digital Twin.  Go to [this web page](http://40.115.24.34:8080/Thingworx/Runtime/index.html#mashup=mockup_v3&forceClose=true&__fromNextGen=7d195fde-35e2-4e1c-8932-2aaecc90e408) and view the webapp for the Digital Twin.

<a name="of1"></a>
## Arduino
Contains all the code used on the two Arduinos, from the libraries used, the code, to how the physical setup was done

<a name="of2"></a>
## Branding
Contains official branding materials and fonts.
<a name="of3"></a>
## CAD & Setup
Includes various CAD files for the robotic arm
1. Spaceclaim files for both complete model and idealized model for simulation.
2. Creo files for export to Vuforia
3. Stl files for 3D-printed parts


The folder also contain a guide on the physical components used and the assembly and set up of physical robotic arm with sensors.

<a name="of5"></a>
## RuntimePythonForTwin
Includes files and documentation for the python scripts running the ROM of the robotic arm and performing damage calculation.

<a name="of6"></a>
## Thingworx
Contains documentation for the Thingworx platform, including the custom made extensions and the settings necessary to make them work.

<a name="of7"></a>
## Vuforia
Includes all versions of the Vuforia projects for both iPad and Hololens. Also AR graphics and Thingmarks are included.

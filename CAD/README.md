# Intro
This folder contains four subfolders;
1. *CAT* - Cat files exported from spaceclaim for import to Creo, and later export to Vuforia for real time movements in AR-apps.
2. *CREO* - files for export to Vuforia, as creo and Vuforia are very compatible
3. *Housings* - housing for the sensors, stl files for 3D-print
4. *Spaceclaim* - Idealized geometry for FE-model and full geometry for visualization.
